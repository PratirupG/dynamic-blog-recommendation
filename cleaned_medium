consider one final apple relate series number iphones sell globally quarternow time series work notice does not exhibit general trend also predictable cycle within trend — you will see spike sales year correspond apples first quarter account year start october first quarter pick holiday sales goal time series techniques often find exploit predictable pattern like even pattern subtler harder spot seasonal pattern iphone salesrolling average trend time seriesa common first step approach new time series project smooth data something like roll average two main benefit one real world data tend jump around bite even clear underlie trend look roll average make easier tell trend move underneath noise second find trend similar manner first step towards create seasonal decomposition let us look real example common starter time series data set show number airline passengers per month us fiftiestheres obviously upward slope air travel go relatively rare luxury late fortys much common experience sixtys there is also clearly seasonal pattern travel consistently higher months rather others month month variation make hard see exactly fast growth smooth monthly fluctuations consider roll average consecutive months consider together particularly high low value one month therefore temper less extreme value months roll window consider original data alongside six month roll averagethe roll average does not get high original data peak low troughs one thing may notice particular example also does not seem hit peak troughs exactly time original data roll average specifically trail average six months make average give month months point five precede months alternative might consider center window month could instance consider month two previous months two subsequent months five month window tend work better odd number months one coincide peak troughs data rather lag month soyou might able see already strategy issue get towards end data set — cannot consider average future month data yet example center roll average simply stop two months end dataset trail average go way edge ways deal — perhaps get towards end start run future months start consider fewer months close gap — may satisfactory course trail average also similar problem one begin series cannot take average last six months you are say month two three data set also vary size window adjust much smooth increase window roll average get less less peakythere ways smooth time series find trend line tend variations theme simple average one common one worth mention exponentially weight move average ewma true name average previous periods weight recent periods count averageclassical seasonal decompositionone use create smooth trend line fashion perform seasonal decomposition break original data components trend cyclical deviations trend whatever residuals leave go smooth line full decomposition well notice increase size roll averages window impact seasonal fluctuations fade away roll average consider window size seasonal cycle essentially wash seasonal cycle altogether consider one month cyclewere look seasonal cycle account differences original data seasonless roll average two ways try calculate seasonal element first additive model method  will imagine true value give month value trend month plus static seasonal value change month month within year stay roughly month consecutive years hopefully small amount error leave let us start calculate detrended series take original series subtract trend itthis detrended series show us seasonal cycle along whatever noise data set simply consider month within cycle one one much trend average january data point average february simply take month month average get approximation seasonal cyclelooking average seasonal components like see clearly air travel vary month month much travel summer months winter model original data comprise trend seasonal componentour model data green line is not horrible it is clearly get problem — consistently overshoot early years consistently undershoot later years actually could foresee problem arise graph detrended data saw seasonal swing get extreme case simple fix consider second way decompose time series multiplicative modelthe multiplicative model work similarly additive one except case say final data give month value trend multiply seasonal adjustment stay roughly year year additive model say something like number flight typically forty higher trend june multiplicative model say number flight typically tenpercent higher trend june way multiplicative model scale size seasonal cycle trend rise fallscalculating multiplicative seasonal cycle similar calculate additive one except find detrended series divide original data trendwe find monthly adjustments average month detrended series model data trend multiply appropriate seasonal adjustmentmuch better might already able tell successfully decompose time series set fashion depend crucially properly identify period seasonal cycle yearly cycle take two years six months often time clear calendar cycle — week week month month year year — depend sort data work might reason conform calendar choose inappropriately size period render decomposition functionally uselessas example imagine look data set like one we have consider did not know represent did not assume even yearly period twelve months happen select eleven month period instead twelve month one well first things seem go ok plot roll average look like you have less remove seasonalitywhen perform rest step decompose series along elevenmonth period however quickly see something is not rightthis seasonal decomposition basically useless add real value smooth trend line see classical decomposition really depend find sensible value periodclassical decomposition may seem simple way oldfashioned boot develop one thousand nine hundred twentys yet hopefully see simple fairly powerful model data well may also clear extend sort technique start predict future value well draw trend extra months apply appropriate monthly adjustmentits also worth bear mind capture time series process general try isolate trend look predictable pattern account look explanations significant deviations complicate ways isolate trend basically necessity look multiple point time try isolate trend day day week week month month variation advance methods look predictable pattern detrended data include methods consider multiple pattern different periods happen time principle also work much wayin next post time series I will profile advance methods extend predict future valueswritten

response coronavirus word disastrous add disaster catastrophe new global pandemic you have think something like you are exactly right yet media fairly poor job explain let meamericas stimulus program give oneoff payment one thousand two hundred people — even that is conditional income good enough right wrongevery rich country guarantee incomes form sweden ninetypercent denmark subsidize seventy fivepercent incomes take capitalist society world britain even incomes guarantee britain eightypercent income europe nations go even make emergency payments workers long crisis last mortgage already suspend another way guarantee incomesby measure americas paltry one thousand two hundred oneoff payment look inadequate — deeply profoundly sobefore come ways let us discuss americas response dismal fear inflation wrack economy people get pay free nothing could wrong inflation often misunderstand americans american economics put kindly joke really spiral wag pricesnow think average american suddenly work — face prospect sudden longlasting bankruptcy word average american face deflationary shock one total like never see modern history overnight literally income go zerothat deflationary shock ripple outwards economy cause price fall people will not enough money buy level stuff price everything house food cars forth deflation probably will not make headline they will full profiteer scandals course profiteer take place across larger economy effect deflationary shock always depressiondepression mean lose incomes americans lose save home whatever assets like retirement college fund forth struggle afford basics even already — remember america already economy seventy fivepercent struggle pay basic bill like food house utilities even coronavirus imagine even poorer thatthe stage set depression precisely idea danger government support people catastrophe inflation backwards — real danger deflation deflationary shock take place speak like megaearthquake extinction level event make millions americans go relatively paltry income … zero incomethat one thousand two hundred payment people is not nearly enough job are not suddenly go magically come back bring second reason americas coronavirus response inadequatebusinesses already go bankrupt many count take look block many small medium size businesses shutter doors verge local bakery brewer butcher — even one leave americas stimulus program offer little real support economy give megacorporations huge bailouts everyone else offer little real support maybe — stress maybe — average business get small loan tax break government good loan tax break basis business simply fall apart think supply chain it is complex web businesses like ecosystem shock lose customers suddenly ripple outwards upwards sure businesses take loan get minorleague tax break does not solve problem income businesses still soon fold debt spiral control revenues plunge near zero — amount tax break fix eitherloans really stimulus feed does not give bank loan crisis — simply throw free money literally simply put money account central bank yes really precisely america do businesses guarantee incomes guarantee personal incomes that is italy germany businesses risk do not get loan get grant spain france get government guarantee fund guarantee mean debt probably write crisisjust sudden loss income people create extinction level deflationary shock sudden loss income businesses deflationary shock — businesss revenues suddenly fall zero — rip economy cause mass layoffs bankruptcies extinction whole sectors stage historic depression setthat bring third biggest reason what is miss stimulus package take look brave doctor nurse they are fashion mask pizza box they are desperately try get patients share scarce ventilators what is miss stimulus package … stimulus real thingwhat mean massive historic generational wave investment healthcare like americas never see is not obvious that is what is necessary right americas barely functional healthcare system — economy — hardly cope magnitude shock yet day announce stimulus package government also proclaim could not spend billion dollars … ventilators wait perhaps see problemlet put plainly stimulus bill is not really one does not put say trillion dollars towards build new hospitals clinics care center … another trillions new labs research facilities university research program does not recruit million people ten sudden work gear whole economy towards build miss resources society cripple disease urgently need kind work stimulus does not create institutions like work progress administration — time people work factories suddenly build ventilators mask million bright young people research pandemics harder army everyday people visit elderly make sure they are ok legions make film pandemic write — things equivalent dig ditch pandemic yet think much necessary crucial work moment think much work really — build resources need whether simple things like ventilators mask new research development fast man manage chronicle moment literature film build whole new hospitals clinics create whole new sector crisis planningthis stimulus does not does not even billion dollars scarcest urgently necessary resource — ventilators petes sake — let alone new hospitals clinics staff exist ones betterthe result americas economy still scarce resources need fight pandemic like ventilators mask stimulus is not one does not invest anything new alllet put formal technical term stimulus stimulus does not create resources lead larger surplus society stimulus stimulus suddenly massively invest society new resources create often whole new institutions must build — like depressions wpa reconstruction finance corporation — coordinate manage investmentsthe whole point stimulus suddenly rapidly expand societys surplus resources — especially desperately necessary ones — is not stimulus desperately necessary resources differ crisis crisis time around ventilators mask hospitals care workers factories transportation meanwhile mass unemployment set insee obvious solution government employ people suddenly unemployed break balance equation — create desperately necessary resources need create new institutions — healthcare crisis agency pandemic response bank reconstruction finance corporation — better even people employ create another scarce resource plan coordinate stimulus — genuinely take collective action invest together create surplus critical resources suddenly desperately lackthis bill literally none zero way it is stimulus bailout it is rescue corporations wall st old it is bailout capitalism — expense economy people life itselfwhats depression society desperate scarcity — whether money home income medicine basics — usually result sudden catastrophic shock correct result real stimulus — keynes discover century ago — precisely society surplus critical resources otherwise deflationary spiral set wag price fall tandem people get sharply poorer real term fast price critical resources rise course — amidst fresh terrible povertybut poverty disaster add catastrophe depression result shock — loss war natural calamity

essentially next nothing set stage depression — bailout capitalisms megarich already much average person small business long little instead massively invest create surplus critical resources … does not invest anything allthat go hear surreal horror stories doctor make mask pizza box nurse die treat sick without protective gear … even lose job incomes … megarich go laugh way bankdont get wrong

wake fact today president want reopen economy course mean millions people back work … risk live … infect global pandemic … infect love ones forgive I am go blunt maybe even little harsh I will gentle  will talk like adults maybe you will gain something read american cannot seem deal pandemic well judge nobody expect society ruthlessly lethally capitalist america save average prole pandemic … instead exploit harder expect america save … should not never expendable capitalism another quarter profit … another million dollars billionaires … higher stock price expendable capitalist society does not mean local tiny microbrewery bakery drycleaner sorry I am die hard marxist love business trade commerce enterprise local bakery microbrewery capitalism predatory capitalism americas weirdly soviet totalitarian capitalism — money cost vast corporate entities superpeople bend every social political economic institution single onedimensional end — something juncture sane people find problematic let explain begin simple observationcapitalist societies long enough home house everyone enough money pay everyone decent income enough food fee everyone enough professors teachers educate everyone enough medicine treat everyone yet they are never — history — give things people technical term capitalist societies huge surpluses resources — yet people struggle entire class group things do not find odd strike bizarre raise question society ample resources give everyone better life — earth keep people there is really one possible answer question go like capitalist society are not see deserve things things must earn also mean nobody intrinsic inherent worth course definition inherent intrinsic worth basic human right things like house healthcare medicine oni want think point carefully closely really interrogate get itif society ample food medicine money home — yet people still struggle things conclusion society must think people inherent worth else would society deny people things already yet precisely seventy fivepercent americans americas society ample home money medicine food — yet that is many americans struggle afford things that is marx call exploitation immiseration exploitation — work things basic right immiseration society enough provide things reason cannot quite fathom nobody much reason system ideology belief nobody intrinsic inherent worth point human existence endeavour think action onedimensional make profitthat fatal flaw heart capitalism want distinguish everyday business commerce trade might great awesome wonderful ceo small medium size business give employees unconditionally excellent capitalism hand — mckinseys storm troopers march boardroom demand rationalization goldman sachs sell poison derivatives small towns invest concentration camp — is not interest thingscapitalism does not allow inherent worth put simpler way it is indifferent life death particular literally does not care live die many respect it is happier you are dead you are burden — form say tax social systems you are unproductive inefficient cost money capitalism much happier dead aliveyoud fair think exaggerate … well right right capitalism demand americans go back work risk live spread pandemic see love ones die … profit continue upward spiral powerful direct visceral example capitalisms indifferent live die prefer dead alive moment cost money capitalist society nobody intrinsic inherent worth — case fundamental aspect … live capitalist society run one purpose I have already allude point mean every single think action idea interaction behaviour society maximize profit there is point profit earn fairly sure — think local microbrewer baker capitalism quest profit endless perpetual demand turn harder harder exploitation — point true immiserationagain you would forgive think exaggerate long ago today consider americans work harder anyone else rich world — harder people poor world yet incomes have not rise five decades do not decent healthcare education retirement childcare — kind social system meanwhile superpeople know corporations — entities superhuman right power — go millionaires billionaires mega billionaires exploitative enough yesterday today americans exploit even harder they are make go back work face global pandemic much exploitative system even get maybe gulags suppose different really make go back work risk sure death americans reach outer limit exploitation else call make work fatal disease ravage rich country yet there is exploitation there is immiseration exploitation what is easy see americas bigwigs take massive unfair slice pie thus drive people formerly know middle class poverty immiseration what is harder see idea society enough go around — surplus yet surplus never share precisely capitalism cannot allow thing happen profit would craterive already point america ample home money food medicine — yet americans struggle afford things that is immiseration let us apply concept americans make work pandemicthe point americans do not need work pandemic literally reason do not need make work basics like home medicine money food — society massive surplus things already do not need work pandemic similar reason america easily rich enough simply support whole economy months pandemic — wise right fair moral thing nobody need work america rich society — work really need do pandemic tend ill feed indigent make sure diseases spread slow forth work americans make literally nothing real labour anyone really need new home build right trip dentist pair new designer jeans maybe see mean know know real reason americans make work pandemic money profit rise stock market rise rich get richer word system does not collapse cynic might even darker interpretation americans know place they are beat weary terrify anxious never really time energy question insanity abovebecause insanity really word else would call society massive surplus home money medicine food — yet seventy fivepercent people still struggle afford things that is insanity three reason first progress possible people make work things already reason anyone really create anything new positive lifechanging bother exploit people already — mobster might call extortion second regress tend happen feel desperate bitter grow poor insecure I am likely turn demagogues like idiot america president right third societies like fall apart see society surplus things need desperately — would trust institutions leaders system anyone anything bang society plunge distrust enmity hostility superstition way literally begin disintegrate — way america isthats immiseration friends insanity society deny people things abundant surplus america use things like medicine food money education today — even grimly — thing americans deny … abundant surplus … figure yet it is life you are make go back work pandemic risk life there is literally reason reason except profit ultra rich yet good reason — we have establish society massive surplus profit money denominate life life worth — good money really buy violence right harm life digress americans — last week — immiserated money food home education medicine society huge surplus things yet americans never enough deliberately withhold americans make compete viciously brutally instead profit could skyrocket forevertoday americans immiserated life institutions literally tell must work — else one side risk lose live yet they will lose incomes little healthcare retirement stability kind choice choice say one side do not live do not eitherbut outer limit immiseration it is one thing society withhold surplus home food medicine money life basic right infect global pandemic infect love economy profit stock market megacorporations keep go keep

thousand twenty houston first noah vonleh shabazz napier keita batesdiop gerald greenwell start denver they are easydespite number name there is ton need say malik beasley juancho hernangomez talented neither really establish denver free agents summer wouldve surely expect leave juancho vanderbilt were not even rotation beasley depend night pretty low totem poleessentially denver consolidate three lowvalue assets whose value expire turn houstons firstround pick come twentytotwenty five range essentially replace denvers pick trade jerami grant way nuggets trade trio jerami grant work otherwise get pick probably get trade singular asset that is good worktheres decent chance one denver trade would even play many playoff game year need reminder heres talent ahead name peck order murray harris barton millsap jokic grant porter morris plumlee craig that is ten guy napier vonleh play vonlehs even good enough allow denver move plumlees expire deal find second trade tomorrowit stink move young talent denver go lose guy nothing summer get pick instead little cost sweettwo thousand twenty brooklyn first evan turner two thousand twenty four golden state secondclint capela nene hilarioatlanta pretty clean analysis nene turner irrelevant turner bad money expire deal nene cut days I am sure hawk include warriors pick it is hard care much secondround pick five draft awayessentially hawk trade firstround pick clint capela sure seem like slam dunkfirst note brooklyns pick atlantas hawk get one take allen crabbes bad salary cap space were not use anyway they are move pick capela that is awesome business it is also great business hawk trade least valuable pick keep net pick fifteentoseventeen range year bad draft there is little chance hawk couldve get someone anywhere nearly good capela wouldve take years develop find even didi love capela fit atlanta hawk one worst center rotations league badly need defensive center capela good defender great rim runner rebounder sheer talent capela fine honestly he is probably little worse look far houstons system jam harden surely inflate valuebut asset capela much valuable he is twenty five years old fouryear sixty sixmillion contract that is palatable deal pay capelas entire prime capela better player andre drummond steven adams name hawk rumor trade probably asset he is far valuable drummond wouldve likely cost atlanta almost twice much sign summer capela atlanta still well fifty million cap room teamcapela fit atlanta far better drummond adams hawk already guy need ball hand capela set mean screen roll hard rim he is #blessed go one topten passer arguably two another trae young defense capela dirty work exactly team need is not go magical fix team young john collins he is start he is far better anything team hadatlanta eventually need start doling money trae collins kevin huerter contract extensions deandre hunter years likely topseven pick line capelas bargain deal even valuable roster agesas asset contract I had rank capela topten nonrookiedeal center league might even topfive seven he is obviously behind guy like jokic towns embiid gobert think anyone else arguable I had probably prefer brook lopez myles turner jusuf nurkic others along number rookie deal point — average start center cheap deal valuable even modern nbacan capela play well enough stay court game matter could not houston that is go problem atlanta will not play conference finals next four years great deal either wayrobert covington shabazz napier noah vonleh jordan bell keita batesdioptwo thousand twenty brooklyn first malik beasley juancho hernangomez jar vanderbilt evan turnerit really feel like deal make sense four team minnesotas side definitely one like least best it is incomplete worst it is rush panic movethe wolves give best player trade robert covington return get potentially nothing affect team longterm that is problemyou might know many name deal heres quick breakdown napier championship uconn has not do much nba though he would start point guard vonleh bell serviceable bench big men batesdiop upside never find much play time four name go are not real loss napier vonleh bell summer sign make impact probably move good faith chance get playoffs lose kbd bummerevan turner longtime veteran never impress nba player he is essentially nightmare scenario outcome jarrett culver goodnotgreat defender cannot shoot need ball hand offense does not pop athletically hopefully culver learn turners positives next months turner is not buy outthe brooklyn pick … fine probably end fifteentoseventeen range pretty bad draft year make lottery ticket maybe give minnesota ammunition add pick move spot shoot star gerrson rosas hunt star asset play churn name assets try find something worksthe net pick lottery protect bite risk involve east playoff picture pretty soft kyrie irving get hurt net miss playoffs pick roll next summer would likely #twenty five range kyrie kevin durant back would relatively disastrous wolves since pick crown jewel trade themmalik beasley classic gunner two guard he is sort guy win game get hot shoot right he is beasley make thirty ninepercent threes last two season hit eighty sixpercent line he is sort shooter minnesota simply create shoot is not afraid moment beasley is not much passer is not good defense — hence classic gunner two score hurry it is easy see fit well nice complement next culverjuancho hernangomez longtime favorite nerds like though might aaaa player look good summer league international play spain never establish much play time he is tweener big man lack strength juancho start thirty seven game career average eleven seven forty six thirty nine seventy five shoot split fit theoretically next karlanthony towns though disaster defensivelyjarred vanderbilt lottery ticket like kbd vanderbilt genuinely incredible rebounder does not really nba position nba skills cannot hurt take look vanderbilt sort outofthebox player rosas love give chance fit guy like naz reid jake layman jordan bell rosas hunt cheap value eventually someone hitwith beasley juancho key factor final year rookie contract mean they will free agents summer ostensibly mean wolves couldve sign either one free summer though that is really true team strap cap room denver couldve match offeryoud think team definitely plan keep beasley contract negotiations directly determine valuable many restrict free agents get screw negotiations summer little cap room patient minnesota could luck bargain beasley deal flip side could also happen take one team lot team use young shooter someone offer beasley sixty million next four years wolves compel match do not walk away covington trade players show they are stick overprice player that is riskreward game herethe true juancho far lesser extent could actually get start next towns market eventual price much tepid it is important wolves play hernangomez enough see they have get could easily become bargain deal choose keep himbeasley hernangomez vanderbilt nice young assets upside that is exactly roster need right nowbut worth price covington best trade asset roster he is go minnesota show expire rookie deal middle pick bad draft minnesota essentially trade covington two first flip houston first denver playersbut urgency trade covington threeandd players always valuable covingtons sort guy would help almost playoff team still twoandahalf years deal play one leagues valuable nonmax nonrookie contractswas really best minnesota could get covington sure net pick handful spot higher pick playoff team what is really worth draft brooklyn pick really worth much outgo trade asset deal dangelo russell whoever next piece worth anything comparable covington find hard believecovington always go get trade sooner later felt like rush decision he is good nba starter minnesota did not get starters return beasley probably will not one neither draft pick think minnesota hold onto covington wait right deal they are still stick bad wiggins dieng contract real way get contract let alone add teamthe good news team stink rest season topfive pick way defense disastrous without covington team literally does not nba point guard roster trade covington sort like trade spot summers draft it is draft load lead guard prospect minnesota much better position get pick litterbaby step guesstwo thousand twenty houston first clint capela gerald green nene hilariorobert covington jordan bell two thousand twenty four golden state secondthe rocket interest team trade team trade one starter another especially since starters different  will see rocket team still sing capela cough cough daryl morey mike dantoni never halfmeasure guy go allin they have ever go threes small ball capela go

trick neither deanthony melton dillon brook would grizz part brandon clarke I am drool zionclarke partnership new orleans multiple chance draft did not botherthis bite outlandish say ingramjjj swap it is hard build perfect hypothetical fit next zion jjj point I had even consider add another pick asset get job do new orleans do not see memphis take deal — especially think sign ingram free summerthats real problem ingram deal admittedly moment pelicans start quietly offer ingram around interest team get suspicious suspicious there is something do not know ingram suspicious pels do not want sign ingram longterm mean might able get free they are patientbut that is fun else play portland could offer anfernee simons plus piece like zach collins nassir little pick simons worst pipm regular league he is pretty intrigue attack guard prospect portland offer cj mccollum instead mccollum holiday pretty interest partnership along zion pels would need add lot salary value probably notif new orleans worry ingrams fit might like mikal bridge lot he is better defender hypothetically better shooter need ball less would phoenix offer bridge kelly oubre would bridge pick enough atlanta intrigue ingram destination leave summer hawk badly need second handler newfound shoot would huge bonus trae young plus brandon ingram would really start something would atlanta give john collins potential star collins fit next zion kevin huerter probably do not move deandre hunter pels already pass cam reddish atlanta pick unless new orleans want collins is not great fit I am sure right deal therethe interest deal might actually new york ingram could face knicks franchise mitchell robinson look theoretically like monster defensive center perfect fit next zion would knicks part rj barrett would zion want old duke run mate back is not rj barrett underdevelop brandon ingram right rj mitch tantalize there is much risk involve sidesthe knicks would probably prefer keep barrett pair ingram maybe offer kevin knox mitch probably throw dennis smith frank ntilikina add much new york draft pick want ingram want make sure keep summer would give enough piece make tantalize offerin end would admittedly quite shock see brandon ingram get move even pelicans secretly ready move there is path later — exactly buck malcolm brogdon last summer new orleans wait til summer make sure max

israel open businessnearly fund survey report still actively look deal rest assume passive posture still indicate they would opportunistically invest exceptional deal come alongdespite plan stay active market investors say they would probably take fewer initial meet likely call however seem drive less reduce appetite external factor mostlymost investors express belief meet pace would pick people families settle cadence work home kidswhile it is clear data vcs israel open business it is equally clear business look different today say three months agomy first observation data funds age key investors think capital allocation timemost manage relatively fresh fund report make change allocation money new deal reserve support exist portfolioconversely investors tail end fund indicate
