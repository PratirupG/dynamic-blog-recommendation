3,3,How to Get Beautiful Results with Neural Style Transfer,https://towardsdatascience.com/how-to-get-beautiful-results-with-neural-style-transfer-75d0c05d6489?source=collection_category---4------1-----------------------,recently become interest generate medium profile picture machine learn pull deep land neural style transfer nst conceptually simple understand generate high quality image surprisingly difficult lot intricate detail unmentioned trick one must implement correctly order get great result article  will dive deep neural style transfer examine trick detailthere number solid introductions nst medium publications will not waste time go basics idea nst want follow along article great way get start look official pytorch tutorial unfortunately like many introductory article final implementation generate mediocre result best figure one  will spend next section update tutorial code improve transfer quality first go tangentall accompany code article find githubmost gatys et al paper introduce neural style transfer simple straightforward understand however one question get address gram matrix natural way represent style ie texture high level gram matrix measure correlations different feature map layer feature map simply postactivation output convolutional layer example convolutional layer sixty four filter output sixty four feature map gram matrix measure correlation similarity feature map every feature map layer without necessarily care exact pixel position illustrate reasonable measure texture suppose two filter one detect blue things one detect spiral apply filter input image produce two filter map measure correlation filter map highly correlate spiral present image almost certain blue mean texture image compose blue spiral instead red green yellow spiralsalthough explanation still leave slightly uneasy seem widely accept fact texture synthesis community gram matrix correspond style article explain furthermore cannot deny result get use gram matrix impressivethe first step improve transfer quality fix pytorch tutorial implementation tutorial try faithful gatys et al paper miss things along way one thing papers author replace maxpooltwod avgpooltwod find produce higher quality result another detail tutorial compute contentloss styleloss output convolutions instead relu activations nitpick since notice big difference use convolutions vs relus experimentsthe egregious difference tutorial paper wrong layer use contentloss styleloss respectively put wrong quote choice layer largely subjective depend heavily produce please style say rule thumb use guide decision measure content similarity lower layer tend activate highly pixel perfect match content_img generate input_img deeper go network less layer care exact match instead activate highly feature generally right place visualize layer concern set style_weight run train process random input_img use different layer content_layerthe tutorial use fourth convolution convtwo_two figure two content layer see figure three likely low layer use content network still care match pixels exactly depth gatys et al use convfour_two instead much concern overall feature arrangement instead individual pixelsin case style lower layer respond small repetitive feature higher layer capture abstract global feature therefore order transfer whole style style_img — low level detail overarch motifs — include layer depths network tutorial use first five convolution layer fairly low network unlikely capture global feature gatys et al use convone_one convtwo_one convthree_one convfour_one convfive_one nice distribution layer across entire network hierarchy use method use content visualize style choice layer optimize set content_weight specify style_layers want use run train process random input_imgas expect style optimize tutorial layer capture low level repetitive feature fail capture high level global featuresthe fix we have implement far get us fairly close quality see gatys et al paper  will go even deeper look next step take generate even better imagesone first things change paper switch optimizer lbfgs adam paper author claim lbfgs result higher quality transfer notice difference use adam experiment furthermore adam seem stable especially train large number step large style_weight case lbfgs seem nan probably due explode gradients though did not look deeply another minor tweak switch mse_loss ie ltwo loss lone_loss cannot think good reason use ltwo loss style transfer besides differentiability square term heavily penalize outliers allude previous section do not really care match pixels exactly tolerate outliers generate image indeed outliers may even lead visually please result style content feature blend together finally author feature visualization — must read article relate topic — also use lone_loss task likely similar reasonsactually lot trick use generate high quality feature visualizations elegantly transfer neural style transfer fact fv nst conceptually similar differ generate input_img nst input_img optimize activate different layer network way content_img style_img fv hand use content_img style_img instead generate input_img maximally excite neurons different layersone trick borrow fv use data augmentation input_img work exactly regular classification task step apply augmentations input_img eg rotation crop resize etc run model compute loss augment input_img step we are force input_img generate feature robust minor perturbations robust feature contain less high frequency artifacts generally look visually appealing¹ however find augmentations use feature visualization article aggressive scale appropriately even still rotation artifacts develop around edge generate image figure five simplest way get rid artifacts crop image pixels finally last modification make switch content_layer convthree_two instead convfour_two gatys et al use article read also recommend convfour_two though find fine detail get wash convfour_two style overpower content generate image hand convthree_two still maintain fine detail without overpenalizing pixel perfectness like lower layer indeed confirm case look figure three againweve discuss trick I have implement neural style transfer code point we have substantially improve transfer quality original pytorch tutorial furthermore content_weight style_weight lot robust specific choice image example pytorch tutorial find good style_weight one set image readily transfer another set without proper tuningthat say it is possible get even better result try remove high frequency noise generate image interest approach come across article differentiable image parameterization — another must read touch similar topics article author generate input_img first parameterizing decorrolated fourier space instead corrolated pixel space since input_img generate via gradient descent decorrelating input act preconditioner make optimization easier allow gradient descent find minima quickly similar remove correlate feature supervise learn task lead higher quality transfer entirely clear besides handwavy explanations like minima find decorrelated space wider robusta simpler approach dampen high frequency noise penalize either directly indirectly noise directly penalize add total variation loss input_img optimization objective conversely it is possible implicitly penalize noise either blur input_img gradient descent step blur gradients apply input_img one issue approach also adversely penalize true high frequency feature somewhat ameliorate scale either total variation loss amount blur trainingif make far know quite lot generate beautiful image neural style transfer conceptually simple get high quality result require lot care original goal use machine learn generate medium profile picture much trial error think I have stumble something look pretty strike excite part whole process endtoend differentiability neural network little effort able invert model originally train discriminate cat dog use

aspect business due advancements technology great data scientists analysts also create real problemsthe main issue cause pace analytics integrate business process due fact people do not much statistics education often have not revisit topics since school days create real problem organisationsblind conviction decision make base metrics figure do not actually hold run rampantif data scientists analysts it is vital remember work occur void analysis share impact decisions make it is important keep mind build report dashboards etc ensure do not unintentionally mislead end userssimply put cannot substantiate number would anyone believe analysis worse analysis unintentionally mislead cause serious harmin article explore different factor cause decision makers mislead avoid workthe first thing think mean term averagethere three mean median modewhen see term average could refer one commonly average refer mean always work opt call mean average unless specifically request otherwise clientill go indepth mean mislead due fact multiple ways different datasets could yield mean example three value one two three mean two two twothe main way mean mislead due outlying data comparatively large small value large impact meana real life example company could average sales £ twenty five month executives see satisfy companys position reality average sales skew due £ fifty month customer due acquire competitor imminent loss customer actually drop mean say £ fifteen risky cash position company scenario see distribution another type average could help executives foresee events prepare themi tend towards better approach include descriptives scenario present result leave little room error alway remember think end users need guarantee have not spend hours scan raw data like do not make assumption knowledge datasetthe analysis show three completely different datasets mean average count sum however different distributions keep scale similar emphasise point situation happen frequently analytics often completely sweep rugdescriptive statistics must come analysis simply make nice metrics graph without proper context cause harm good you are plan use average part report dashboards recommend least show distributions context behind average understandable please remember label mean mode medium you are unsure appropriate average dataset would recommend research detail beforehandstatistics often quote without reference original data well miss certain figure could act creators hypothesisan important question ask present find whose interest figure correct is not say figure incorrect way know definitely therefore figure solely rely uponif you are present data always cite source methods anything else relevant you are leave something ask answer defensive nature do not leave many fake facts do not need anymorea common examples misrepresentation survey data information method sample size leave often include things total total download figure marketers love conveniently leave metrics like active usersthis show clearly follow two statements accuratechinas gdp higher luxembourgs luxembourgs gdp higher chinasthey true chinas total gdp much bigger however per capita luxembourg much higher case you are able make argument economies perform better otherstatistics often use prove point solidify opinion though reality often do not succeed eitherits easy enough come poignant statement back quasi sophisticate statistics fall dig little beneath surfaceone statement would ceos earn ever statement come back figure average ceos earn £ two hundred fifty compare one thousand nine hundred fifty earn £ fifty seem like resound proof actual fact £ fifty one thousand nine hundred fifty give equivalent buy power £ four hundred eighty today despite first appearances statement ridiculous know may seem obvious many less obvious one thereanother common example I have personally see large hr analytics software company state website clients achieve eightypercent roithere two major issue statementsfirstly mathematics perspective phrase could effectively mean anything scenario ie companys clients may receive zero percent return investment single client may achieve eightypercent therefore statement true misleadingthe issue statements assumptions make methodology let us say scenario product company sell sales software calculate increase sales first year use versus previous year lead roi eightypercent conveniently leave fact sales grow fiftypercent year software introduce therefore claim increase cause software baseless increase within normal operate trend client alreadyan easy tip avoid simply avoid generalisation leave much room error remember you are try tell story data story need include detailsthis probably common mistake make look statistics consequences hugelets say want understand relationship workplace engagement employee length service conduct survey gain resultsyou see positive correlation length time engagement level conclude longer someone work organisation engage sure really case though firstly need access distribution length service close normally distribute level large skew distributions remember little value compare apples orangesthankfully helpful method understand important correlation p value calculation use show probability result correlation coefficient zero p value less fivepercent five correlation deem statistically significantthis mean correlation causation worth look determine whether correlation fact due cause effect relationshipdue naivety around mean p value simply rely correlation coefficients alone things appear relate often state prove cause effect relationship find two things correlate wish understand relationship bayesian statistics would helpful tool understand data depthsome simple things consider regard correlations usual correlations fall four categorise positive negative relationships uncorrelated pretty self explanatory correlate really sometimes thing statistically correlate reality do not relationship occur chance two ways avoid get data conduct experiment put relationship test control condition actually correlate input relationship influence condition change could alter break relationship remember data does not exist void things change do not assume ceteris paribus causal input directly dictate output consider order relationship eg x cause change opposite relationship bidirectional course depend nature datacorrelations vital part data science easy get carry away get result look really dig fully understand what is go you will surprise findmost may seem quite obvious fast pace business environment it is easy creep analysis without anyone notice especially you are use shelf analytics tool do not allow inspect raw data run custom query formulasas general rule better practice do not understand know happen behind pretty graph cut edge machine learn model should not rely output come decision make always provide

question ask describe insert data science concept though fiveyearold talk sister study become elementary school teacher decide question bite hyperbolic perhaps emphasis catchy decide keep catchy title article slightly focus explain concepts adult nontechnical background keep theme however also create graphics go along answer depict draw would accompany explanation access whiteboardthe topics follow orderfor hypothesis test first start question large group example average height americans guess five ft eight base personal experience know cannot realistically measure height every single american randomly pick smaller group measure random sample see average height americans really five ft eight would conduct hypothesis test example would need use onesample ttest specific equation go deep important thing aware need know number people measure average height standard deviation heights aka far away heights average get value tvalue ttest need use chart program evaluate whether conclude pretty sure — ninety fivepercent sure — average height americans tvalue larger oneninety six less oneninety six would say reject hypothesis average height americans five ft eight range fail reject statistics lingo hypothesis conclude actual average height americanssometimes dataset many columns variables hard work put variables model would cause run slowly would also hard visualize relationship dependent variable one try predict variables pca come head definitely leave fiveyearold level explanations one complex math linear algebra pca transform variables components graph leave call biplot show component one component two make original four variables however variable represent one component another green variable two vector example high value component one stay two component two value thus variable two significant part component one component twothe goal smaller number components number variables model run faster also want components retain much information original variables possible analyze choose many components put model would look metric call explain variance ratio metric tell percentage total variance dataset component explain hopefully first illustration section make idea little clear ideal scenario would choose number components include model add ones explain variance ratio reach cumulative total around eightypercent eightfinally one point clarification lose ability interpret result model use pca components best figure components meaningful model look biplots like one show variables contribute information componentslets say database really like collection excel sheet table sql join easiest understand via example example table look likefor example let us assume students whose information student table enrollment table currently enrol class also students enrol class whose information student table type join would tell youso type sql join want use query aka code send database get data back depend information want know want know phone number students enrol class use inner join want name year every student along class happen enrol anything would use leave joinwe venture model territorythis one tough explain nontechnical audience bear methe bias variance tradeoff classic data science concept state inherent tradeoff bias variance create model start description term briefly explain tradeoff twobias model high bias fit data well say accuracy low data use make model train data data use test model test see crossvalidation section high bias indicate something miss data use wrong model example data look like twond order polynomial x² try use linear model x predictions like top graph illustrationvariance model high variance sensitive small change independent variables dataset issue associate overfitting model fit data train well identify noise randomness dataset important really is not thus introduce new data see poor performance prediction example fit data twond order polynomial x² relationship twentyth order polynomial x²⁰ see graph tradeoff two issue exist tweak model fit data better decrease bias necessarily increase variance tension overfitting model data collectedthe image leave one simple decision tree could make start top ask question observation row dataset follow tree reach outcome would predict valueit easy decision tree overfit data worst version would every outcome tree represent exactly one observation datasetto solve issue random forest model use essentially program generate bunch decision tree one look little different due randomness involve model make decision split outcomes tree average get final prediction method allow make smaller tree reduce variance model keep accuracy popularand finally bite validate modelscrossvalidation best practice evaluate kind machine learn model image show would split dataset want perform crossvalidation three time threefold crossvalidation split data would build model train segment test model generate predictions test set average accuracy score split get good picture good model really data scientists use smaller total amount data test model larger variety data model see beforewhen employers ask question seem want asses two thingsi hope article helpful
